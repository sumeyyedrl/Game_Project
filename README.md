# Escape Room

This project has been given for the Web Programming class. I created a simple game by using HTML Canvas and manipulated it with Javasicript. In this game you are controlling the charecter around the game area. Collect the keys that shows up rundomly and watch out the walls. Once you collected 5 keys you need to go to the door and escape the room! Don't forget that in order to escape the room you need to collect all the 5 keys otherwise you won't be able to escape the room through the door.
