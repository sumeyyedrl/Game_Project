# Escape Room

This project has been given for the Web Programming class. I created a simple game by using HTML Canvas and manipulated it with Javasicript. 
Collect all the keys and escape from the room through the door!

## Getting Started
In this game you are controlling the charecter around the game area. Collect the keys that shows up rundomly and watch out the walls. Once you collected 5 keys you need to go to the door and escape from the room! Don't forget that in order to escape you need to collect all the 5 keys otherwise you won't be able to escape from the room through the door.
This project mostly includes Javascript codes. Key press and mouse click are listenning by the event listenners and helping you to control the game. Other than that HTML Canvas element creates the chance to draw the game on a website.
